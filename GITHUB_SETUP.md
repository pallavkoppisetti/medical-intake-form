# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Steps to Create and Push to GitHub Repository

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" (+ icon in top right)
3. Repository name: `medical-intake-form`
4. Description: `A comprehensive React TypeScript medical intake form application with professional healthcare UI`
5. Set to Public (so Claude can access it)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
8. **DO NOT** add license (we already have one)
9. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medical-intake-form.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub (first time)
git push -u origin main

# For future pushes
git push
```

### 3. Verify Repository Setup
1. Check that all files are visible on GitHub
2. Verify README displays correctly
3. Ensure the repository is public for Claude access

### 4. Repository URL for Claude
After pushing, your repository will be available at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medical-intake-form`

Share this URL with Claude to enable GitHub connector access.

git push -u origin main
```

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

3. Use GitHub Issues for tracking enhancements
4. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
5. Enable GitHub Pages for demo deployment (optional)
